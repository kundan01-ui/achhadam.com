- **System Configuration**: Settings, permissions, audit logs
- **Relational Data**: User relationships, business connections

### MongoDB - Dynamic Agricultural Data
- **Crop & Farm Data**: Listings, inventory, farming practices
- **IoT Sensor Streams**: Weather, soil, irrigation, monitoring data
- **AI/ML Models**: Crop advisory, predictions, recommendations
- **Communication Logs**: Messages, notifications, chat histories
- **Content Management**: Media files, documents, user-generated content

- Real-time features for live agricultural operations  
- Multi-language support for diverse farming communities
- Robust security for financial and personal data
- Scalable architecture for growing user base
- Integration with agricultural ecosystems and government systems
- Mobile optimization for field usage

**Production Considerations:**
- High availability with 99.9% uptime targets
- Scalability to handle millions of users and transactions
- Security compliance with financial and agricultural regulations
- Performance optimization for mobile and low-bandwidth connections
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems
- Disaster recovery and business continuity planning

**Technology Integration Points:**
- Weather APIs for real-time agricultural data
- Payment gateways for financial transactions
- Government APIs for compliance and subsidies
- IoT platforms for sensor data integration
- AI/ML services for crop advisory and predictions
- Blockchain networks for supply chain transparency
- Mobile platforms for farmer field applications

This comprehensive plan provides detailed prompts for building a production-ready agricultural platform backend that can handle millions of users, transactions, and IoT data points while maintaining security, performance, and user experience standards suitable for the Indian agricultural market.
