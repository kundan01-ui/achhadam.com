## 🚀 Production Deployment Solutions

### Problem: Legal Pages 404 Error
The issue is that production servers don't know how to handle client-side routes like `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-conditions`, etc.

### Solutions by Platform:

- ✅ SPA routing properly handled

#### 2. **Vercel Deployment**  
- ✅ `vercel.json` file is configured
- ✅ Routes properly defined
- ✅ SPA routing supported

#### 3. **Apache Server**
- ✅ `.htaccess` file is configured
- ✅ Rewrite rules for SPA routing
- ✅ Legal pages properly handled

#### 4. **Nginx Server**
- ✅ `nginx.conf` file is configured
- ✅ Location blocks for legal pages
- ✅ SPA routing supported

### 🔧 Manual Server Configuration

If you're using a custom server, add these configurations:

#### Apache (.htaccess)
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

#### Nginx
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

#### Express.js
```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
});
```

   ```
